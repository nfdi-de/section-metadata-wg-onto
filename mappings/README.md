This folder serves to collect existing mapping/alignment files in any possible
format for the purpose of getting an overview of what kind of
mappings/alignments we already have/could reuse.

Even if the format does contain a metadata section describing the purpose, scope
and applicability of the mapping, you should add some minimal context regarding
these aspects in this list section of this README as well for an easier
overview.

As such, this folder serves as a interim low level mapping registry, until a
better one can be recommended by our WG.
