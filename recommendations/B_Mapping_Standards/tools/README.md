# Mapping Tools

The goal of this document is to highlight recommended mapping tools. A mapping
tool is a reusable workflow that can be used to predict, review, curate, or
reason over semantic mappings.

The goal of this document isn't highlight mapping formats like SSSOM, JSKOS,
etc. nor software that simply implements object models and I/O for the formats.
