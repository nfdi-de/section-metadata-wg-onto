## SSSOM Curator

SSSOM Curator (https://github.com/cthoyt/sssom-curator) is an open source  project that has a few parts:

1. A simple Python-based workflow for generating lexical mappings between
   ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and any other resource that mints
   identifiers
2. A web-based curation tool for manually reviewing predicted mappings
3. A workflow for publishing all generated + curated mappings in SSSOM, with
   detailed provenance information

It was originally called [Biomappings](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings),
but was generalized and made domain-agnostic.

### Artifacts

Mappings that are curated in the Biomappings project are stored in SSSOM under
version control in the GitHub repository. They can be accessed through this
