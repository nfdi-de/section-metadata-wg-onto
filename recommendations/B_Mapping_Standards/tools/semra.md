# Semantic Reasoning Assembler and Mapper (SeMRA)

The Semantic Mapping Reasoner and Assembler (SeMRA;
https://github.com/biopragmatics/semra) is an open source Python package that
provides:

1. An object model for semantic mappings (based on SSSOM)
2. Functionality for assembling and reasoning over semantic mappings at scale
3. A provenance model for automatically generated mappings
4. A confidence model granular at the curator-level, mapping set-level, and
   community feedback-level

## Artifacts

SeMRA was used to assemble a large-scale database of raw semantic mappings from
hundreds of ontologies and databases in SSSOM:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11082038. This is periodically refreshed and can
be rebuilt locally with `semra build`.
