# Mapping Tools

## Biomappings

Biomappings (https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings) is an open source project that has a few parts:

1. A simple Python-based workflow for generating lexical mappings between ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and any
   other resource that mints identifiers
2. A web-based curation tool for manually reviewing predicted mappings
3. A workflow for publishing all generated + curated mappings in SSSOM, with detailed provenance information
