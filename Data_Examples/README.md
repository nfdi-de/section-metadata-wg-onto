This folder is meant to be used for examples of datasets from each consortium
which are annotated using common terminologies. The goal of such examples is the
testing of frameworks such as
[CDIF](https://cross-domain-interoperability-framework.github.io/cdifbook/) or
[I-ADOPT](https://i-adopt.github.io/) to have some practical examples on how to
implement these in harmonized manner throughout NFDI.

It is still open on how to best structure and provide the content within this
folder. With regard to the structure, we will start out with subfolders for each
framework (e.g. [CDIF_Examples](../Data_Examples/CDIF_Examples))
