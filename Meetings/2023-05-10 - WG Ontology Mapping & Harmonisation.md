M4Ing \- ontology

- atm a very general process model
- why not reuse OBI, IAO and other OBO ontologies, although reusing BFO?
- reusing BFO2020?
- how do you import external ontologies?
  - do you import the whole ontology or make custom import modules?
    - how do you make sure you have all axioms from the external ontologies?
    - Dorothea: manually curated import modules
      - Philip: entails the risk of getting out of sync with the external
        ontologies and missing axioms of terms which would essentially change
        the semantics of the reused term
- [documentation](https://nfdi4ing.pages.rwth-aachen.de/metadata4ing/metadata4ing/index.html)
  \- ability to hide parents to not confuse novice user
- Philip: Is it meant as a schema to be reused or an application ontology?
  \(asking because of the first steps guide\)
- Naouel: do you have mappings to the top level terms used from external
  ontologies?
  - Marc: logical declared/asserted in the ontology

OBO/OBI Process pattern

- Marc Fuhrmann: How can you specify in a fine grained fashion what the inputs
  and output of processes are when it comes to information\.
  - Philip: IAO:plan spec is an IAO:information entity and can thus have as
    parts other IAO:information entities\. In
    [Slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SouuZxX2ehVPWoY-KSgYFE1n3LvOgp6hZWjWlDTMp5w/edit#slide=id.g2419522a800_0_1)
    you can see IAO:setting datum as being part of the plan specification, and
    this class can be used together with the
    [OBI data modeling pattern](http://obi-ontology.org/docs/data-intro/) to for
    example say that one part of the assay specification \(actually its action
    specification part\) is to set the device temperature to 30� C\.
