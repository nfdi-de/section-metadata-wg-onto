# <a id="_3cakx2qk2ogo"></a>Agenda Notes

- report sent away
- State of BARTOC 2023\. Virtual BARTOC Editors Meeting
  [https://doi\.org/10\.5281/zenodo\.8069920](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8069920)
  - new funding end of the year, relations between ontologies and terminologies
    planned
  - Jakob is editor and can be asked for changes and editing rights
- NFDI4Objects
  - uses CIDOC CRM for the upper level and uses the LIDO data format
- Which entities and their characteristics are the same throughout all NFDI?
  - We need to find out which entities need to be represented throughout all
    NFDI consortia that are not describing the domain specific research data but
    only the common general domain entities needed in the description of
    research data\.
    - It is still unclear how we can best find out such common
      entities/properties
    - As suggested in previous calls and our submission to CoRDI, one approach
      could be to use the I\-ADOPT framework to at least describe research
      variables in a common way\.
    - Could the [NFDI4Culture ontology](https://nfdi4culture.de/ontology) be a
      useful grounding framework for that?
- re: our overview of
  [Used Ontologies @ NFDI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAfDKo2gKiaFldEeitMUcO8Gl1Fjyb_r_bp1V4JW0Es/edit#gid=0)
  - We decided to write to the contacts gathered in there to announce that each
    consortium has the chance to enter their reused/developed terminologies into
    their spreadsheet until the 31\.7\.2023, so we have enough time to then
    start with our analysis\.
  - Emphasis discussed: Only those terminologies need to be listed in there,
    which are actually reused or being developed\. Those that are merely index
    or evaluated are not part of the analysis\.
- Philip: asks Oliver and Felix regarding analytics of used ontologies
  - So far our analytics do not track fine grained enough information to
    determine who s using the TS in what kind of settings\.
- **We need to prepare the following tasks/topics for the next calls \(taken
  from our charter\) \-> your help is needed:**
  - Assessment of existing approaches to achieve �cross\-domain knowledge
    sharing�, e\.g\., minimum common metadata schemas
  - Define minimum information standard for NFDI data publications required for
    semantic interoperability
  - Identify and prioritize concrete needs for mappings across terminologies
    and/or knowledge graphs, by working groups staffed by all the involved
    consortia\.
    - should be based on the analysis of
      [Used Ontologies @ NFDI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAfDKo2gKiaFldEeitMUcO8Gl1Fjyb_r_bp1V4JW0Es/edit#gid=0),
      which has to be done first
  - Suggest recommendations on mapping tools, mapping creation, mapping
    validation, mapping documentation, and mapping publishing \(e\.g\., on the
    Terminology Service\)
    - we should plan to have presentations after summer about: SSSOM,
      JSKOS/COCODA, talking about best practices on how to release
      mapping/alignment artifacts,
    - WG TS will present something relevant to this in our WG as well
