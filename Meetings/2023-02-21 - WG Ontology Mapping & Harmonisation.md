# <a id="_4in35gwl6myp"></a>Participants

- Philip Str�mert \(NFDI4Chem\)

# <a id="_3cakx2qk2ogo"></a>Agenda

- get an overview of what each consortium is working with
- identify the differences, synergies & pain points needed to be discussed,
  e\.g\.:
  - number of consortia using the same top & mid level ontologies
  - differences between disciplines \(e\.g\. humanities & natural sciences\)
- addresses the specific tasks from
  [WG Charter \- 3\. Work Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUh7K0Sy8tyrKZ4-BEizb-9Qa0tt3uzE/edit#heading=h.9mqm7qmjqjz)
  - Evaluate existing domain\-agnostic vocabularies
  - Evaluate existing upper\-level ontologies
- Which are the upper/top\-level ontologies of the ontologies we use?
- Which of the ontologies we use are developed by a consortium?

prepared by:

- all participating consortia are asked to fill out their tab within this
  worksheet
- it would be great if someone could make a short analysis of the ontologies
  listed in there \(e\.g\. \# of consortia using BFO as TLO, \# of consortia
  using OBO\(RO, IAO, OBI\) / Wikibase / DCat / ProvO, �\)

**discussed aspect of main topic**

**prepared or present by **

We need to clearly indicate which ontologies are developed as part of the NFDI\.

## <a id="_xdfcjrjekv9s"></a>domain\-agnostic vocabularies

- OBO framework
  - [OBO Relations Ontology](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/ro)
    - all domain agnostic relations used in OBO
  - [PATO \- the Phenotype And Trait Ontology](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/pato)
    - physical qualities/attributes, like temperature, mass, length etc
  - [Information Artifact Ontology \(IAO\)](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/iao)
    - information objects that are not physical \(e\.g\. the content of a data
      set\)
  - [Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/obi)
    - although rooted in biology, it contains many very general concepts, such
      as planned process or device, patterns for modeling data from measurements
      and predictions

- [Basic Formal Ontology](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/bfo)
  - current PURL resolves to the BFO2\.0 version used as classes only backbone
    by the OBO Foundry
  - [https://github\.com/BFO\-ontology/BFO\-2020](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020)
    hosts the 2020 ISO version
    - includes

- [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology \(SIO\)](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/sio)
- [General Formal Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/GFO)
  - seems outdated, as last release in 2006, also unknown number of users
- SUMO or CYC
  - no open version available\!?

Notes from the call

- Mark Doerr: let�s have some people present TLOs to the other
- Marc Fuhrmans: agree on some guiding questions for analyzing TLO
  - should the outcome be to align a domain ontology completely to one TLO?
  - should the outcome be to mix TLOs in domain ontologies according to their
    �strengths�, e\.g\. BFO for processes and EMMO for material entities
  - the latter might be equivalent to a suggestion of top level entities for
    typical entities encountered in domain ontologies
- Matrix of typical entities to be modeled vs TLOs with corresponding term plus
  some notes on use / strong points
- we need to have as part of our focus the differentiation between when to use
  reasoning and when not
- a very powerful feature of ontology structured \(meta\-\) data are federated
  queries, so combining information from different data\-sources, therefore a
  better understanding of what is important to achieve optimal federated queries
