- [Used Ontologies @ NFDI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAfDKo2gKiaFldEeitMUcO8Gl1Fjyb_r_bp1V4JW0Es/edit#gid=0)

**Main Topic:**

- evaluate which ontologies are used in the various NFDI
  - identify the differences, synergies & pain points needed to be discussed,
    e\.g\.:
    - number of consortia using the same top & mid level ontologies
    - differences between disciplines \(e\.g\. humanities & natural sciences\)
- presentations \(15 min\) about EMMO & CIDOC\-CRM
- first informal �mapping�
  [table/overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAfDKo2gKiaFldEeitMUcO8Gl1Fjyb_r_bp1V4JW0Es/edit#gid=1839424810)

**Short intro to EMMO**

- [https://github\.com/emmo\-repo/EMMO/](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO/)
- developed by philosophers and physicists
- multiperspective aspects
  - to cover different aspects of how to look at / model the world
  - supposed to cover arts as well as natural sciences
    - covers many basic \(quantum\-\)physical concepts and SI units as the basis
      of describing materials
- semiotic perspective \(emmo:Semiotics\)
  - to represent the semiotic triangle that includes the interpreter, sign and
    real world \(semiotic\) object
- causal perspective
- mereological perspective \(parts\-whole relations\) \[cf\.
  [https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Mereology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology)\]
- Importance of EMMO for chemists on quantum Level to model reactions,
  characteristics

**Questions regarding EMMO**

- What was the need to make yet another TLO?
  - PS \(answer based on the talk?\): with EMMOntoPy there is a direct bridge of
    using an ontology directly in ones code
  - Answers: Need to describe physical objects \(on a quantum level /
    wave/particle dualism\) in detail
- Advantage of EMMOntoPy is a programmatic access to the ontology from python
  code\. Can a more generic approach be accessing an API of a TS \(e\.g\.
  [TIB TS](https://terminology.tib.eu/ts/ontologies/?sorting=)\)?
- How will these abstract TLO concepts be documented to make sure that users
  with less knowledge can use EMMO correctly?
  - common argument against TLOs like BFO that its concepts are labeled and
    defined too incomprehensible/abstract to be reused in a more concrete
    setting
  - Are there design patterns defined for EMMO that will make sure to
    reuse/expand it properly, e\.g\. a plain weight measurement pattern?
    - measurement modeling examples from Mark Doerr:
      [https://gitlab\.com/opensourcelab/scientificdata/ontologies/openscienceontology/measurements/\-/tree/main/oso_measurements](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/scientificdata/ontologies/openscienceontology/measurements/-/tree/main/oso_measurements)
- Are there any mappings to other TLOs or ontologies with top level / general
  concepts?
  - Mark Doerr will raise an Issue on EMMO github repo\.
- EMMO�s modules are expected to be developed using EMMOntopy \(based on
  owlready2\) \- how does this setup relate to the Ontology Development Kit
  \(ODK\)
  - EMMOntopy is more light\-weight \(and also less powerful\) than ODK\. It is
    a simple �pip install emmontopy�, no docker image, in\-built workflow
  - EMMO itself is still developed with Proteg�
  - Are there templates \(repo structure\), automated checks etc?
    - yes, to some extent: there is a tool, called �emmocheck� for testing, if
      the developed sub\-ontology is designed according to the EMMO guidelines:
      [https://github\.com/emmo\-repo/EMMOntoPy/blob/master/docs/tools\-instructions\.md\#emmocheck](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMOntoPy/blob/master/docs/tools-instructions.md#emmocheck)
  - [https://github\.com/emmo\-repo/EMMOntoPy](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMOntoPy),
    general approach for any ontology
    [https://pypi\.org/project/Owlready2/](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/)
    ?
  - Is the Python based dev approach documented in tutorials/how tos?
    - - since it is owlready2 based, most of the \(good\) documentation
      - of owlready2 applies to EMMOnotpy \-
        [https://doi\.org/10\.1007/978\-1\-4842\-6552\-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-6552-9)
      - the EMMOntoPy documentation could still be improved
    - How are users expected to do it right?
      - for developments on EMMO itself EMMO uses the discussion tools of github
        \- with the feedback from the EMMO community to verify that it was done
        �right� \(whatever �right� means :\)
      - simple design errors are checked with emmocheck and a github pipeline\.
    - how can a Python based approach be synced with a GUI based dev e\.g\. via
      Protege or Webprotege?
      - EMMOntopy/owlready3 allows to import common file formats \(owl/xml, ttl,
        e\.g\.\) but there is no RDF\->EMMOntoPy python code converter\. Imports
        python classes\. One has to decide whether to develop an ontology with a
        python representation or a GUI representation\.
      - EMMO \(core\) is to my knowledge still developed with Proteg�, EMMOntopy
        is only currently used by domain ontology developers
- How big is the current user base?
- Is there a use case in the biological or biochemical domain modeled with EMMO
  that shows the advantages of using this TLO vs to use BFO or SIO?
