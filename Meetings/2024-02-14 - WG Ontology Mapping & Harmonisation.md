# <a id="_71znd1hi3viy"></a>Notes

for Possible topics:

- as discussed after the last meeting: we might want to discuss how we want to
  structure your approaches to ontology harmonization with regards to meeting
  agendas\. We often discuss very different topics from meeting to meeting and
  therefore not manage to discuss or record the results from previous meetings\.
  **Therefore my question is do we need another meeting structure or do we need
  another way to record results\.**
  - If just Philip is preparing > too much work for one and leads to bias
    \(which might be problematic\)
  - we jump too much from topic to topic > need to be more precise need to have
    more structure in our WG
  - Jael: our goals although being in the charter there are not used to
    structure the meetings
    - when we have presentations, we should
- If wanted there can be a short overview on DCAT / DCAT\-AP, however with
  regards to the previous topic i really would like to first discuss how we want
  to record and document results\.
  - postponed to another call with more participants
  - fore shadowing: mainly used in 4Cat to describe the dataset provenance but
    also contains a way for how to describe a dataset’s content with more domain
    specific vocabs/ontologies
- Jeal showed interest in preparing for a call that would discuss the use of the
  most current DataCite MDS ;\)
- Hendrik:
  - use the first 10 min of each call to upvote the topic for the next call, so
    it becomes clear who is supposed to do what
- David:
  - presentations should not be too broad in terms of a grand overview but
    should be more specific in terms of being in line with our objectives, goals
- Josh
  - GDoc is not well enough suited > LinkML community example as better way?
    using GitHub issues?
    - see
      [https://github\.com/linkml/linkml/issues/974](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues/974)
    - GH idea supported by Hendrik, Philip, David
      - but the majority would have to like this approach too and we would need
        to properly describe how to use GH in our context
    - Nice issue 1:
      [https://github\.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1)

## <a id="_1f8l04fmowo9"></a>The participants of this meeting will test the GH approach

- @Cord will set up a WG repo under
  [https://github\.com/nfdi\-de](https://github.com/nfdi-de/WG)/
- Philip will start a draft repo \(to be moved to the one that Cord sets up\)
- We will go over the Goals and Tasks section of our WG charter together with
  the proposed topics in the overview GDoc to destill this down to possible
  “epics” and “subtask” issues, which will hopefully allow a better
  collaborative organization of our WG
  - good first Epic/issue example could be our discussion around the proper
    vocabularies to describe the research information of all NFDI datasets
    \(e\.g\. DCAT vs CERIF vs DataCite …\)
- this GH test will thus already be helpful to structure our next calls, even if
  we decide to not use this approach in the end
- GH handles needed for the test:
