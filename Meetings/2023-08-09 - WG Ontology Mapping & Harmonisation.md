- upcoming CORDI presentation preparation
  - submitted
    abstract[CORDI 2023 \- Finding a common ground for NFDI terminologies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y8BiM8czU9RMfFQY6v5HKXMNI9IKmQaFsA3FdXTW_5k/edit#heading=h.htr67yedhcw)
  - ontology use analysis started in
    [NFDI_harmONTOmap_analysis\.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16KX6M7Ysmx787Jdnl_CagJvP1k8_4PYq/view?usp=drive_link)
    - needed questions
      - which upper & mid level ontologies are used?
        - check which are using: RO, BFO, OBI, IAO, PATO, PROV, CIDOC, TIME,
          SOSA, EMMO, I\-Adapt, Schema\.org, Dublin Core, Spar\-Ontologies?
      - which consortia use BFO/PROV/CIDOC/TLO aligned ontologies?
      - which are the most shared \(domain\) ontologies between all consortia
        \(apart from the TLOs\)?
      - **need to add new clumn for the type of semantic artifact:
        owl/skos/undefined to be able to analyse which are mapable \(=owl|skos,
        as other formats are ignored by us for now\)**
      - license analysis: which are open and �
      - list/analyse number of which ontologies of �same/similar� domain are
        used through which consortia
  - Naouel will do slides for the I\-Adopt part, we need help with the slides
    for the WG presentation & Ontology analysis part
- what to do in the next calls and who will prepare what
  - 22\.08\. we�ll continue to talk about the analysis of the used ontologies
  - 12\.09\. will be cancled due to CORDI and another Humanities conference
    happening at the same time
  - RE our charter Objective: _Suggest recommendations on mapping tools, mapping
    creation, mapping validation, mapping documentation, and mapping publishing
    \(e\.g\., on the Terminology Service\)_
    - 26\.09\. Jakob will present JSKOS/COCODA as implementation example of
      parts of this objective \(to be confirmed if it will really be on that day
      or maybe in a later call\)
    - As a response to Philip asking in the OBO\-Slack SSSOM channel, if anyone
      could present how SSSOM is currently used for data integration and/or
      ontology mapping/alignment\. Charles Hoyt replied: �I am happy to give a
      talk on Biomappings, which goes one step further in analyzing what are the
      gaps and how to fill them in mappings between ontologies and other
      terminologies\. � <\- might be quite domain specific already, but seems
      good nevertheless to get a better understanding about how SSSOM is used in
      the wild\.
    - TODO: It seems best if someone from our WG could go over the
      [SSSOM docs](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/) and subsequently
      present shortly in how far this framework compares to the JSKOS/COCODA
      framework and how it can/might/should be used to address this objective\.
  - We need to improve the organization of our WG in terms of preparing and
    evaluating our calls and todos\. All our ressources are limited and we need
    to better divide the work between each WG member to get things done ;\)
