## <a id="_5eb0sr1jyk9j"></a>layers of metadata

taken from the email thread, we have these layers of metadata:

1. "meta" research information \(metadata about the organization and outputs of
   funded research processes\)
   1. \-> This is the fokus of KDSF but also mostly\(?\) in DCAT\.
2. outer view on shared research data object \-> This is DCAT\.
3. inner view of shared research data objects \-> Discipline models/ontologies

\-> layer 1 & 2 can be subsumed into one layer that represents the research
information metadata

- this assumes that detail information about e\.g\. a creator, funder or project
  is provided elsewhere and just referencing it by PID \(persitent ID, e\.g\.
  ORCID, ROR or DFG\-ID\) is sufficient

**\-> Our recommendation regarding layer 1 for all NFDI consortia**

- use CERIF as standard for the research information metadata
  - can be transformed to DCAT, Schema\.org, Datacite or Wikidata based on
    existing mappings \->
    [https://eurocris\.org/news/cerif\-rdf\-mapped\-most\-common\-metadata\-schemes](https://eurocris.org/news/cerif-rdf-mapped-most-common-metadata-schemes)
    - needs to be worked on in terms of implementation in cookbooks/guides
    - see also:

      - [https://ec\-jrc\.github\.io/datacite\-to\-dcat\-ap/\#mapping\-summary](https://ec-jrc.github.io/datacite-to-dcat-ap/#mapping-summary)
  - Experimental CERIF\-Ontology in RDF exists at
    [https://cerif\.eurocris\.org/model](https://cerif.eurocris.org/model)
  - DCAT and DCAT\-AP is probably the more widely used standard when having RDF
    data, as CERIF is originally XML based and just recently ported to RDF
    - so we need to find existing mappings and transformation guides between the
      two \(e\.g\. CERIF XML metadata to DCAT RDF metadata\)

## <a id="_rgry5ybnmjen"></a>Next steps

- **How to attach the domain specific �research data� metadata to the DCAT/CERIF
  based �research information� metadata�**
  - who knows how this is done in other projects?
    - how is it done when using RDA�s [I\-ADOPT](https://i-adopt.github.io/)?
      - seems a good candidate framework for describing only the observed entity
        and its characteristics \-> lacks expressivity regarding the used method
        of the observation
    - how is it done when using the
      [Cross Domain Interoperability Framework CDIF](https://worldfair-project.eu/cross-domain-interoperability-framework/)
      - we need to get more info about this and how it fits into our WG work
  - Hendrik tries to present how 4Cat attaches domain specific metadata to the
    research information metadata part described with DCAT\-AP
- Our recommendation to use CERIF for the research info metadata layer should be
  written up in a properly publish format asap
  - should link to guides on how to use DCAT\-AP and CERIF
    - seems to be part of the tasks from WG Cookbooks \-> we need to aks them
      what they already have in this regard
      - @Holger will ask Susanne Arendt how much their WG have in this regard
