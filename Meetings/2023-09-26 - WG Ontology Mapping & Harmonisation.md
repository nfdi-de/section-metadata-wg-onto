# <a id="_71znd1hi3viy"></a>Notes

- Philip needs to send out emails before each call, 3 days in advance
- need more participation for preparing agendas for the upcoming calls
  - need to make our topic proposals more prominent
- CORDI

  & other output from the conference that might be of interest to this WG
  - analysis part was critiqued
    - not clear enough what was actually achieved by the WG
  - I\-ADOPT part was critiqued
    - was not made clear enough, that this is not �THE� upper level framework we
      should all adhere to, but that is is only a �PROPOSED� way to commonly
      describe **the research variables** that were used in the creation of a
      specific dataset, so that the dataset can be found with an I\-ADOPT based
      federated query\.
      - e\.g\. ask all the NFDI SPARQL endpoint to retrieve me all datasets in
        which the iadopt:variable idaopt:hasObjectOfInterest NCBITaxon:9606
        \(Homo sapiens\)
- refocusing on tasks and goals of wg onto mapping & harmonization
  - we need to put more energy on focusing on specific topics/aims of our WG
  - Hendrik
    [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ik62-09h6YgFHL4EDrDj1yOxll0aasunEkYC0Xz5WZ4)
    a constructive criticism that asks in how far we have been addressing the
    main goals of our charter so far\.
  - Jakob: �How similar are two ontologies?� is a different question than �How
    interoperable are two ontologies?�

1. RE AIM: Increase cross\-domain interoperability within NFDI and other
   infrastructures \(EOSC\) by providing linkages and crosswalks between
   terminologies, ontologies, and domain\-specific knowledge graphs\.
   1. we need to focus on what not to include in our mapping efforts
      1. no meta terminologies like: SHACL, OWL, RDF
      2. Jakob: better ask how something is used instead of what it "is"
   2. what about DCAT, Schema\.org, should they be included in our mapping
      efforts?
      1. Philip: Schema\.org & Bioschemas will be used by multiple consortia to
         produce RDFs/JSON\-LD text that will be incorporated in websites of
         repositories in order to allow search engines like Google to index more
         fine grained\. \-> so yes we should have mappings from schema\.org to
         other ontologies like, PROV\-O etc\.
   3. Hendrik: we need hard metrics for interoperability and our WG
      1. Dorothea: Is it really metrics on interoperability that we need or do
         we need ways to get interoperability by agreeing on reference
         terms/terminologies to map to for central concepts?
2. RE WG AIM: Assessment of standards for the creation and maintenance of
   mappings, the formal documentation of mappings and their metadata in
   collaboration with the Terminology Services WG, as well as their
   \(re\-\)evaluation and publication
   1. CORDI feedback: we need better parameters that deal with interoperability
      \-> maybe count/present the number of mappings we have
3. RE WG AIM: provision of formal alignments between commonly used upper\- and
   mid\-level terminologies to support broad semantic interoperability among
   domain\-specific terminologies\.
   1. Hendrik: shouldn�t we rather consider a bottom\-up approach instead of
      current top\-down approach
4. RE WG AIM: Collect, amend, and harmonize quality standards for metadata
   annotations in the context of their practical application in NFDI and EOSC
   \(cf\.
   [WG_Search_and_Harvesting\.docx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmG32Y9t2FwMpwUm_x-HsODsy2O0GMtW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104521175430650419376&rtpof=true&sd=true)\)\.
5. RE WG AIM: Reach out to and collaborate with communities of ontology
   maintainers to ensure that steps needed for harmonization are taken up into
   the original ontology specification as well as to promote the acceptance and
   implementation of changes to the source terminologies\.
6. RE WG AIM: Demonstration of how ontologies are applied to concrete metadata
   \(cf\.�
   [WG Cookbook\(s\), Guidance and Best Practices\.docx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ll1h5Yx6_QMTWx7T_wXYoDCq-WxR4MB-/)\)\.
7. RE WG AIM: Reach out to and collaborate with communities of ontology
   maintainers to ensure that steps needed for harmonization are taken up into
   the original ontology specification as well as to promote the acceptance and
   implementation of changes to the source terminologies\.
8. RE WG AIM: Facilitating the FAIRification of terminologies used in the NFDI
   consortia by providing concrete examples and by embedding them in a FAIR
   �ecosystem� of services to reach semantic interoperability\.�
9. RE WG AIM: Assessment of the diversity/similarity \(on term level\) of top\-
   and mid level ontologies to get a measure on why they are so hard to
   harmonise \- maybe leading also to recommendations for the ontology
   developers to make their ontologies more interoperable\. By this analysis one
   could at least provide recommendations for the whole NFDI, which ontology
   should be used if one wants to model the world from a certain perspective,
   e\.g\. if your view on the world focuses on human artefacts, use these X
   ontologies, if you have a quantum physical perspective on the world, you
   should rather use these Y ontologies as your top\-and mid level ontologies\.
   This assessment could also lead to ontology similarity maps \(analog to
   amazon recommendations: if you like/use this ontology a, you might also have
   a look into that ontology b\)\.
