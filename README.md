# section-metadata-wg-onto

This repository is meant to organize the work of the
[NFDI Section (Meta)Data](https://www.nfdi.de/section-metadata/) Working Group
Ontology Harmonization and Mapping.

This repository is two things:

1. the cloud storage space where we upload and share files with our WG
   members and the rest of the world in a version controlled manner.
2. the space in which we can discuss asynchronously and transparently the
   tasks we need to accomplish via GitHub
   [issues](https://github.com/nfdi-de/section-metadata-wg-onto/issues) and
   [pull requests](https://github.com/nfdi-de/section-metadata-wg-onto/pulls).

## Deliverables
