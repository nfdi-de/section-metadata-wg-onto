# section-metadata-wg-onto

This repository is meant to organize the work of the [NFDI Section (Meta)Data](https://www.nfdi.de/section-metadata/) Working Group Ontology harmonization
and Mapping.

This repository is two things. First, it is the cloud storage space where we upload and share files with our WG
members and the rest of the world in a version controlled manner. Second, it is the space in which we can discuss 
asynchronously and transparently the tasks we need to accomplish via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## Deliverables
* Working Group Charter [published version (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6726518) & [editor version (GDoc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUh7K0Sy8tyrKZ4-BEizb-9Qa0tt3uzE)
