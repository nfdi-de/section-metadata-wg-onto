# Ojective

The objective of this docment is described in @charta2022 as following:

> Assessment of standards (i.e. formal, accessible, shared and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation) for the creation of mappings (e.g., SSSOM, OAEI), the formal documentation of mappings and their metadata in collaboration with the Terminology Services WG, as well as their (re-)evaluation and publication. 

This may also include tools, procedures, frameworks and recommendations for the creation, documentation, validation and publishing of mappings.

# Background and terminology

Different domains and projects use different **semantic artifacts** (SA) subsuming all kinds of formal ontologies, terminologies, vocabularies and similar knowledge organization systems in their research data. The individual elements of a semantic artifact (concepts, classes, items...) are referred to as **entities** in this document.

A **mapping** is a managed link between two entities from two semantic artifcats (1-to-1 mapping) or between one entity from one semantic artifact and multiple mappings from another one (1-to-n mapping). The mapping includes additional information such as mapping type, provenance etc.

A **concordance** (also known as crosswalk or alignment) is set of mappings between two semantic artifacts.Concordances can help for data integration and enrichement by bridging the gap between different data models and vocabularies. 

# Review

## Non-Standards but reality

- Visual graphs (mostly with pen and paper): useful for thinking but not formal
- Source code of applications that apply transformations: better than a standard without implementation but not scalable
- Spreadsheets: the plague but unavoidable and handy

## Standards

In no particular order:

- [LinkML-map](https://linkml.io/linkml-map/)
- [JSKOS mappings](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/#concept-mappings) and [Concordances](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/#concordances)
- [SKOS mapping properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping)
- RDFS and OWL properties
- Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM)
- [EDOAL](https://moex.gitlabpages.inria.fr/alignapi/edoal.html)
- ontology mapping & alignment (OAEI) - not a format?
- ...

# Instructions and recommendations

This document may eventually contain recommendations on

- creation of mappings
- validation of mappings
- documentation of mappings
- publication of mappings
- mapping tools
- mapping registries

To get there we will

- Find instructions and have specialist discussions on  from the field of computer science.
- Refer to existing guidelines
- Assess and discuss how to use existing standards in NFDI
- ...

## Tools

Not main topic of this document but should be mentioned.

See @Voss2025^[Online at <https://bartoc.org/software>] for a technical report of KOS software, including mapping editors, generators and converters.

Specific mapping tools partly included there:

- Cocoda
- OpenRefine
- mix'n'match  
- Other Reconciliation API servers and clients
- Alignment API and Alignment Server
- Amalgame 
- Implementations of SSSOM
- ...

- "There are many tools and frameworks that can be used to assist with ontology matching and alignment, such as Alignment API, AgreementMaker, LogMap, AML, and OntoComP."^[<https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-best-practices-tools-ontology-matching?lang=en>]
- ...

Many tools have been proposed in context of OAEI but they rarely become more than a short-lived research demo.
