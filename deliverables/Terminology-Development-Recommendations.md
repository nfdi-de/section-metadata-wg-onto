# NFDIâ€™s Best Practices for Terminology Development & Publishing

## Target audience
The present recommendation is mainly addressed to developers of terminologies, such as OWL ontologies or SKOS 
thesauri, within NFDI. However, its wording is also aimed to be intelligible for domain experts, who are 
collaborating with these developers.

## Glossary
**Editor Note:** We might want to outsource this glossary to a different page/doc, as I imagine this to come in 
handy also in other docs we'll write, e.g. https://github.com/nfdi-de/section-metadata-wg-onto/pull/28/commits/38410712b3c82a9bbe9b9ad5a5c172b8bcc20504

| TLO / Top-Level Ontology | In information science, an upper ontology (also known as a top-level ontology, upper model, or foundation ontology) is an ontology that consists of very general terms (such as "object", "property", "relation") that are common across all domains. An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology |

| thesaurus         | thesaurus (pl.: thesauri or thesauruses), sometimes called a synonym dictionary or dictionary of synonyms, is a reference work which arranges words by their meanings (or in simpler terms, a book where one can find different words with similar meanings to other words), sometimes as a hierarchy of broader and narrower terms, sometimes simply as lists of synonyms and antonyms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus      |
